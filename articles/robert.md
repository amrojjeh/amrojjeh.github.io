# Robert's Crisis

Robert has an illness. It's not a traditional illness, but the kind that becomes one once you merely think it is one. Therefore, he had a very special illness: he was stuck in a loop.

It was not a spiral, as that at least makes progress towards the center, even if you could say its goal was misguided. On the other hand, a loop has no goal, and it makes no progress. It is a repeat of the same old same old.

Robert had three kids. All of of them where somewhere, though none of them were here. Oh, what was even the point of them? This question really intrigued Robert. While he certainly loved them, he didn't know why. Also, he didn't know why they were somewhere at all. And he didn't know why he was somewhere. Who loves him?

Currently, he's sitting on his chair, spinning it round and round. One moment, he'd look at the ceiling. The other, he'd look at his wife's picture on the desk. Then back to the ceiling. I suppose he didn't know which was prettier to him.

In any case, he was stuck in a loop. He was ill. Probably dying, but isn't everyone? Then he realized his wife wasn't dying, and he began to cry.

So Robert was very ill, as all of this was happening midday. Doesn't he have work? Isn't he too old for that? Then a knock came on the door: "it's your landlord; the rent is due."

Robert could imagine that very well. Landlords don't do that anymore, however. They now send text messages, and if they're really serious, they'll send you mail. That said, Robert has yet to witness him send a pigeon, so it's certainly not _that_ serious.

Robert was sick, and he began to laugh, for doctors have jumped on all the opportuntities to treat the newest diseases, yet the oldest one remained destitute of attention. It ran by a common name: sickness of life.

Perhaps doctors neglected it because of its natural paradox. Sickness is what brings you to death, so how could life itself make you sick? Robert was just as perplexed by this question, yet being sick of life himself, he was unable to deny its existence. His laugh came to an end.

Robert was ill, for each day he'd raise many good questions, but is unable to come up with answers, good or bad. A repeat of the same old same old. Sometimes he thinks he's getting more crazy by the day, but, well Robert isn't keeping track anymore. He's lost it.

Robert would do this every day. Today was at midday. Sometimes it's at night. Sometimes it's in the morning. He missed his wife a lot, and his three kids too. Robert was six feet below rock bottom. He was ready to die, for while he did not accept death, he rejected life. A sickness indeed.

Yet today was still different, for while he deploring life, a miracle occurred. Yes, his jar of pickles began to speak to him: "O Robert, why do you cry today?"

Robert was amused. He began to wonder about how the pickles collectively seemed to have contributed to this jar's hivemind. He then processed the question: "O jar of pickles, I cry because I've learned my efforts are useless. I had a good job, I married a good wife, and I raised three good kids, yet at the end of it all I've only a miserable life."

The pickle jar smiled, if you can imagine. "Do you not realize," the pickle jar said, "that goodness stopped as soon as you stopped doing good?"

Robert was struck back. The pickle jar was correct. He shared a good life with his wife, and his three kids were very good to him when they were here. How did it all go so bad? When?

The pickle jar, with all of its wisdom, died. Robert recalled that he was on LSD, and the effects have now gone away. He was still sitting on his chair, though no longer spinning, and he was facing the picture of his wife, with no pickle jar in sight. Also, it's morning.

Robert ended his lease, and with the help of his kids, was able to go and visit them. And while his life did not last very long after that, he died happy next to his kids, and is now ready to see his beautiful wife, with no pickle jar in sight. It was the same old, and it was good.
